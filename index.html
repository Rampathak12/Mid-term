      <h2>Innovative Technologies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Autonomous buses represent a transformative shift in urban transit, offering efficient and sustainable mobility solutions. Their deployment reduces reliance on traditional fossil fuel vehicles, minimizing emissions and traffic congestion. By leveraging advanced technologies, these buses enhance safety, accessibility, and overall efficiency, revolutionizing public transportation in urban centers.</li>
        <li>Maglev trains utilize magnetic levitation technology to propel trains along dedicated tracks at ultra-fast speeds. By eliminating physical contact between the train and the track, maglev trains minimize friction, resulting in smoother rides and significantly reduced travel times. This innovative technology offers a sustainable and efficient transit solution for high-speed intercity and urban transportation networks.</li>
