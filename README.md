# Mid-term
Sure! Writing the code for a next-gen public transit system webpage was quite an engaging experience. I had to pay close attention to detail to ensure that each element of the webpage, from the header to the footer, was correctly structured using HTML. Then, I got to flex my creativity by styling the page with CSS, choosing fonts, colors, and layout to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

Incorporating images was particularly fun because it allowed me to bring the content to life and make it more engaging for the users. I had to select the right images that complemented each section of the page and added value to the information being conveyed.

Adding functionality with JavaScript was both challenging and rewarding. Implementing a form for users to suggest improvements to local transit systems required careful planning and coding. I had to ensure that the form worked smoothly and provided helpful feedback to the users.

Overall, the coding experience was a great opportunity to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing webpage that effectively communicates information about next-gen public transit systems.
